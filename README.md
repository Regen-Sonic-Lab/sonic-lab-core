# 🌱 Regen Sonic Lab

**Regen Sonic Lab** is a regenerative cultural project that transforms collective music workshops into a practice of education and onboarding into Web3. Through continuous cycles of creation, listening, and documentation, the project connects artists, communities, and local businesses to the Celo ecosystem.

## 🎯 Mission

To educate and integrate communities into Web3 through culture and music, building a network of sensitive, decentralized, and regenerative participation.

Regen Sonic Lab transforms cultural presence into on-chain memory through sound NFTs, POAPs, and events involving the use of Celo as a form of payment.

## 🧩 Problem

Despite the advancement of Web3 tools, local cultural communities still have little access to practical training on blockchain, and local businesses have not yet adopted cryptocurrencies as a means of exchange.

This disconnect limits the creative, financial, and social autonomy of artists and small cultural entrepreneurs.

## ✅ Solution

Regen Sonic Lab proposes a living pedagogy: learning happens in the rhythm of music and community exchange. Through weekly workshops and biweekly events:

- Participants create digital wallets  
- Receive POAPs as proof of presence  
- Use Celo in real interactions with cultural products and local commerce  

This entire journey is recorded on-chain, creating a public, cultural, and decentralized reputation aligned with Celo’s regenerative principles.
